# Question 1
The values in RNA represent the amount of RNA being produced in a nucleus visualized by EU-Alexa488. The values in PCNA represent the amount of PCNA in a nucleus visualized by Alexa568. The ratio between the two represents how much transcription occurs per replication.

# Question 2
The highest ratio is APEX1, which affects DNA replication. When knocked down, DNA replication would decrease, which is why RNA/PCNA ratio is larger. SRSF1 is the lowest ratio, which affects RNA splicing. When knocked down, RNA transcription would decrease, which is why RNA/PCNA ratio is lower.
